done == harmonic – adds both a high and a low octave to a root note == done
done == minorChord- forms a minor chord around a root note == done
done == majorChord- forms a major chord around a root note == done
pitch- translates one note from your sheet music into a “sine wave”
sum- adds two sine waves
trim - removes leading and trailing 0’s from your array
delay- repeats a tone based on an echo volume and time interval
done == changeVolume- scales the amplitude of the tone according to a decimal (i.e .80 or 1.20)
done == fade- scales the amplitude of the first/last n seconds from 0 to usual value (or vice versa) depending on parameter: “In”, “Out”. Feel free to use either a linear or logarithmic fade pattern.
done == clip- establishes a max/min for the amplitude of a sound wave. Values that exceed the boundaries of the range are replaced with the max/min
