<h4>Executing External Programs</h4>
You can call external programs in a wide range of conditions. By doing so you can communicate with different programs.<br>

<pre>python /home/pi/printer/calculate_speed.py [[LayerNumber]] [[TotalSolidArea]]</pre>
<br>
<pre>G1 Z1 F[[ExecReturn python /home/pi/printer/calculate_speed.py [[LayerNumber]] [[TotalSolidArea]]]]</pre>
<br>
<p class="text-danger">Please be aware that nanoDLP could not control the external processes. Excessive use of this feature could crash nanoDLP due to high memory usage or stalled processes. As a matter of fact the main reason for nanoDLP crashes is the external program executions, So to increase the reliability, use this feature wisely.</p>
